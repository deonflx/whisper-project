When I was a kid, the first English sentence that I learned was not about daddy or mommy.

00:10.640 --> 00:20.080
The first English sentence I learned was written all over my toys and it was made in China.

00:20.080 --> 00:26.160
All my toys, electronics and school supplies were made in China and the kid in me always

00:26.160 --> 00:27.160
wondered.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.960
Why is this made in China?

00:29.960 --> 00:32.000
Why not somewhere else?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.840
Now that I'm in China, I found the answer.

00:34.840 --> 00:38.320
This country works in ways that I've never ever seen before.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.960
They work hard, they work fast, they work cheap.

00:41.960 --> 00:46.920
There are a billion Chinese people who build everything from skyscrapers to laptops,

00:46.920 --> 00:53.600
to iPhones, to a stupid plastic toys.

00:53.600 --> 00:58.960
To make this in a different country, then that country needs to be better.

00:58.960 --> 01:02.440
Faster and cheaper than here in China.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.440
Yes!

01:04.440 --> 01:08.440
And from what I see, that's a really hard thing to do.

01:08.440 --> 01:09.680
That's one minute!

01:09.680 --> 01:11.680
See you tomorrow!
