[00:00.000 --> 00:06.560]  1700 people died in one night with no explosions and no fire.
[00:06.560 --> 00:11.840]  How? This is the story of the quietest disaster in the world.
[00:12.480 --> 00:20.240]  In 1986, Cameroon, people lived in a village near a lake and the lake killed them.
[00:20.880 --> 00:25.040]  Lake Nios sat on top of an old volcano.
[00:25.040 --> 00:32.480]  For decades, carbon dioxide gas leaked from the volcano underground and got trapped
[00:32.480 --> 00:38.560]  at the bottom of the lake. And one night, the hidden bubble burst.
[00:38.560 --> 00:44.320]  The lake suddenly erupted a massive cloud of carbon dioxide.
[00:44.320 --> 00:50.800]  And because it is heavier than air, it sank down into the villages,
[00:50.800 --> 00:58.160]  replacing all the oxygen, every human and animal suffocated without a sound
[00:58.160 --> 01:00.240]  in their sleep. They all died.
[01:02.480 --> 01:08.160]  What happened at Lake Nios was a wake-up call. This is why, today,
[01:08.160 --> 01:16.800]  scientists monitor lakes for CO2 bubbles to make sure that this never happens again.
[01:16.800 --> 01:24.000]  That's one minute, see you tomorrow.
