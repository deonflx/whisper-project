00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You're trying to get this to be awkward?

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
Maybe.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
Is this your working?

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
I don't know.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
I have no clue why I'm doing this, but I think it'll be fun.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Here's the idea.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Once a day, I'm going to make one video that's one minute long.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
That's it.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
In New York City.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Off to Egypt.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Today.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Kenya.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Ethiopia.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
India.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Nepal.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
In Japan.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
All the way to Man Francisco.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
And then back home to New York City.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Coming with me is one drone.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
One heavy camera.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
One GoPro.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
I'm a tease.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
And cross apart.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
The world is a book.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
And those who do not travel.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
We don't leave.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
One page.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Dogs.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Let's do this.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Let's do this.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
That's day one.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
See you in Egypt tomorrow.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
See you in Egypt tomorrow.
