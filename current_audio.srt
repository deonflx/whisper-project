00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
When I was a kid, the first English sentence that I learned was not about daddy or mommy.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:20,080
The first English sentence I learned was written all over my toys and it was made in China.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,160
All my toys, electronics and school supplies were made in China and the kid in me always

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
wondered.

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,960
Why is this made in China?

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,000
Why not somewhere else?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,840
Now that I'm in China, I found the answer.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,320
This country works in ways that I've never ever seen before.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,960
They work hard, they work fast, they work cheap.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,920
There are a billion Chinese people who build everything from skyscrapers to laptops,

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,600
to iPhones, to a stupid plastic toys.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,960
To make this in a different country, then that country needs to be better.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,440
Faster and cheaper than here in China.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Yes!

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,440
And from what I see, that's a really hard thing to do.

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,680
That's one minute!

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,680
See you tomorrow!
