0	10640	When I was a kid, the first English sentence that I learned was not about daddy or mommy.
10640	20080	The first English sentence I learned was written all over my toys and it was made in China.
20080	26160	All my toys, electronics and school supplies were made in China and the kid in me always
26160	27160	wondered.
27160	29960	Why is this made in China?
29960	32000	Why not somewhere else?
32000	34840	Now that I'm in China, I found the answer.
34840	38320	This country works in ways that I've never ever seen before.

41960	46920	There are a billion Chinese people who build everything from skyscrapers to laptops,

58960	62440	Faster and cheaper than here in China.
62440	64440	Yes!
64440	68440	And from what I see, that's a really hard thing to do.
68440	69680	That's one minute!
69680	71680	See you tomorrow!
